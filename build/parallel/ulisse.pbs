#Start the simulation, remember to select the correct number of threads and processes.
#The maximum performance number of threads in ulisse is 10, (10 physical cores per socket, each node has 2 sockets)
#the number of processes per node should be then 2, 1 process per socket, each process will then spawn 10 threads each,
#filling in this way with 20 threads the whole node.
